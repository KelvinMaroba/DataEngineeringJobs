# DATA_ENGINEERING_JOBS SQL DATA CLEANING 



## Problem Statement

In light of increasing interest among final year computer science students in the field of data within the Information Technology (IT) sector, this project aims to assess the feasibility and prospects for fresh graduates entering the data profession. The report will comprehensively examine the employment landscape, providing insights into the availability of job opportunities, types of roles prevalent in the industry, and salary prospects for aspiring data professionals. By analyzing current market trends and industry demands, the report seeks to equip students with the necessary information to make informed decisions regarding their career paths in the data field

## Data Colection 
The data used was a survey done by data professionals about their industry

Data was found on Kaggle

## Data cleaning and Explorarion

- Step 1 : Create a new Database in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio
- Step 2 :Load data into Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, dataset is a csv file.
- Step 3 : Create a new Query and start with data cleaning using Transact-SQL
- Step 4 : Create a new staging table away from the raw data to avoid making mistakes with the raw data.
- Step 5 : Begin data cleanig with looking for duplicates by using cte's on a combination of all the columns available.
- Step 6 : Verify the availability of these duplicates and delete the entries that are duplicated.
- Step 7 : Start with Exploritory Data Analysis to find insights and metrics on the data
- Step 8 : Narrow dow the insight by entry-level positions to find roles, location, salary and other metrics from the data
- Step 9 : Export each indivisual table of result for visualization in Power BI.
           
### Data Analysis methodologies

The main aim of the Exploritory section of the data Analysis was to tailor the data steer entry-level prospects into roles and countries that are most likely to hire them, so a big part of the SQL queries was including a WHERE clause that filtered the data by entry-level.

## Results and Recommendations

### Results

The data is mostly spread across multiple countries in the world but for guaranteed success, candidates must look at countries like the USA and the UK.

Similarly roles like data analyst, data scientist and data engineer are proven to hire the most entry-level candidates as opposed to other roles in the data field.

### Recommendations
Prospect candidates are most likely to find employement in the fields and countries mentioned above, so the candidates must focus on aquiring the skills needed and narrow their applications to the fields and locations where they are most likely to get employement.
